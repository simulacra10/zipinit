<p><strong>REPRESENTATION IS BROKEN. HERE IS WHY.</strong></p>
<p>The United States was designed to represent people and places. Over
time, we kept the population. We erased the places.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT CHANGED?</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The House of Representatives stopped growing. In 1913, Congress
capped itself. The Constitution never required this.</p></li>
<li><p>The Senate stopped representing states. The 17th Amendment
removed state legislatures from choosing Senators.</p></li>
<li><p>Districts replaced communities. Lines are redrawn. Neighborhoods
are split. Representation floats.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>WHAT WE PROPOSE</strong></p>
<p><strong>ZIP CODE REPRESENTATION (STATE LEVEL)</strong> ZIP codes
already reflect lived communities. They change naturally. They are hard
to gerrymander.</p>
<p>Each ZIP code elects one state delegate.</p>
<p><strong>COUNTY REPRESENTATION (FEDERAL LEVEL)</strong> Counties are
stable political units. They predate the modern federal state.</p>
<p>Each county elects one Representative to Congress.</p>
<p><strong>RESTORE THE ORIGINAL SENATE</strong></p>
<p>Repeal the 17th Amendment. Return Senate selection to state
legislatures.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT BREAKS WHEN SCALE IS WRONG</strong></p>
<p>Representation works only when people know who represents them and
why.</p>
<p>Smaller units mean: - Less capture - More accountability - More
participation</p>
<p><strong>THIS IS NOT A PARTY ISSUE.</strong> <strong>THIS IS A SCALE
ISSUE.</strong></p>

<p><strong>QUESTIONS WORTH ASKING</strong></p>
<p>Why is the House capped when the Constitution never required it?</p>
<p>Who is the Senate supposed to represent: the states, or the
public?</p>
<p>Why do districts change constantly while communities remain
stable?</p>
<p>Why do ZIP codes reflect daily life better than political maps?</p>
<p>Why does representation feel symbolic rather than personal?</p>
<p>How did representatives become managers instead of delegates?</p>
<p>When did geography stop mattering in political accountability?</p>
<p>What incentives change when representatives no longer live among
those they serve?</p>
<p>Can a republic scale indefinitely without changing its structure?</p>
<p>You do not need to agree. You only need to ask.</p>
