**REPRESENTATION IS BROKEN. HERE IS WHY.**

The United States was designed to represent people and places.
Over time, we kept the population.
We erased the places.

**WHAT CHANGED?**

1. The House of Representatives stopped growing.
   In 1913, Congress capped itself.
   The Constitution never required this.

2. The Senate stopped representing states.
   The 17th Amendment removed state legislatures
   from choosing Senators.

3. Districts replaced communities.
   Lines are redrawn.
   Neighborhoods are split.
   Representation floats.

**WHAT WE PROPOSE**

**ZIP CODE REPRESENTATION (STATE LEVEL)**
ZIP codes already reflect lived communities.
They change naturally.
They are hard to gerrymander.

Each ZIP code elects one state delegate.

**COUNTY REPRESENTATION (FEDERAL LEVEL)**
Counties are stable political units.
They predate the modern federal state.

Each county elects one Representative to Congress.

**RESTORE THE ORIGINAL SENATE**

Repeal the 17th Amendment.
Return Senate selection to state legislatures.

**WHAT BREAKS WHEN SCALE IS WRONG**

Representation works only when people know
who represents them and why.

Smaller units mean:
- Less capture
- More accountability
- More participation

**THIS IS NOT A PARTY ISSUE.**
**THIS IS A SCALE ISSUE.**

**QUESTIONS WORTH ASKING**

Why is the House capped when the Constitution never required it?

Who is the Senate supposed to represent: the states, or the public?

Why do districts change constantly
while communities remain stable?

Why do ZIP codes reflect daily life
better than political maps?

Why does representation feel symbolic
rather than personal?

How did representatives become managers
instead of delegates?

When did geography stop mattering
in political accountability?

What incentives change
when representatives no longer live among those they serve?

Can a republic scale indefinitely
without changing its structure?

You do not need to agree.
You only need to ask.
