00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,922
Representation is broken.<break
time="1.6s"/>

2
00:00:03,922 --> 00:00:05,780
Representation is broken.

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,730
Here is why.

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,699
The United States was designed to
represent people and places.

5
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:15,857
Over time, we kept the population.

6
00:00:15,857 --> 00:00:18,225
We erased the places.

7
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:22,497
This matters more than most political
arguments we have today.

8
00:00:22,497 --> 00:00:26,630
Because many of our frustrations are not
ideological problems.

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,906
They are structural ones.

10
00:00:28,906 --> 00:00:31,228
Letâ€™s start with what changed.

11
00:00:31,228 --> 00:00:35,361
First, the House of Representatives
stopped growing.

12
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:42,205
In the early history of the country, as
population increased, the House increased

13
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:48,364
with it. Representation stayed close.
Representatives remained reachable.

14
00:00:48,364 --> 00:00:54,912
In 1929, Congress capped the size of the
House to 435 members with the passage of

15
00:00:54,912 --> 00:00:58,023
the House Permanent Apportionment Act.

16
00:00:58,023 --> 00:01:00,624
The Constitution never required this.

17
00:01:00,624 --> 00:01:03,039
It was a policy choice.

18
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:09,559
The result is that each representative
now speaks for hundreds of thousands of

19
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:15,655
people. That distance changes incentives.
It changes behavior. It changes

20
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:16,925
accountability.

21
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:20,640
Second, the Senate stopped representing
states.

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,756
Originally, Senators were chosen by state
legislatures. The Senate was designed to

23
00:01:26,756 --> 00:01:31,739
represent states as political bodies, not
as collections of voters.

24
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:34,850
The 17th Amendment changed that.

25
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:41,032
Since then, Senators have been selected
by popular election. Whatever the

26
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:47,213
intentions, the effect was structural:
the Senate became a second popular

27
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:47,900
chamber.

28
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:54,210
When both chambers chase the same public
incentives, something important is lost.

29
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,838
State consent fades. Federal power
centralizes.

30
00:01:57,838 --> 00:02:01,600
Third, districts replaced communities.

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,529
Legislative districts are drawn. They are
redrawn. They shift with political winds.

32
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:12,838
Neighborhoods are split. Communities are
rearranged.

33
00:02:12,838 --> 00:02:15,810
But daily life does not work that way.

34
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:23,010
People live in places that remain stable.
They share schools, roads, churches,

35
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:29,556
markets, and local concerns. Political
lines float. Communities do not.

36
00:02:29,556 --> 00:02:34,386
So what is proposed here is not radical.
It is corrective.

37
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:37,312
Our proposals are as follows.

38
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:44,088
<break time="0.9s"/>One. At the state
level: ZIP code representation.<break

39
00:02:44,088 --> 00:02:45,278
time="1.4s"/>

40
00:02:45,278 --> 00:02:50,641
ZIP codes already reflect lived
communities. They change naturally as

41
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:56,792
population shifts. They are difficult to
gerrymander. People know what ZIP code

42
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:57,817
they live in.

43
00:02:57,817 --> 00:03:03,436
Under this model, each ZIP code would
elect one state delegate.

44
00:03:03,436 --> 00:03:09,935
<break time="0.9s"/>Two. At the federal
level: county representation.<break

45
00:03:09,935 --> 00:03:11,077
time="1.4s"/>

46
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:17,434
Counties are stable political units. They
predate the modern federal state. They

47
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:21,619
already handle courts, records, and local
governance.

48
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:24,870
Each county would elect one
Representative to the House.

49
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:31,068
And finally number three. Restore the
original Senate by repealing the 17th

50
00:03:31,068 --> 00:03:34,669
Amendment of the United States
Constitution.

51
00:03:34,669 --> 00:03:37,827
Return Senate selection to state
legislatures.

52
00:03:37,827 --> 00:03:39,731
This is not about nostalgia.

53
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:42,099
It is about function.

54
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:45,303
So what breaks when scale is wrong?

55
00:03:45,303 --> 00:03:51,340
Representation only works when people
know who represents them and why.

56
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:58,128
When units become too large, capture
becomes easier. Accountability weakens.

57
00:03:58,128 --> 00:04:00,210
Participation declines.

58
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,879
Smaller units do not guarantee good
governance.

59
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:08,105
But oversized units almost guarantee
distance.

60
00:04:08,105 --> 00:04:10,055
This is not a party issue.

61
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:12,191
This is a scale issue.

62
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:14,977
You do not need to agree with these
proposals.

63
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:17,531
You only need to ask the questions.

64
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:21,989
Why was the House capped when the
Constitution never required it?

65
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:27,051
Who is the Senate supposed to represent:
the states, or the public?

66
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:32,902
Why do districts change constantly while
communities remain stable?

67
00:04:32,902 --> 00:04:38,614
At what point does representation become
symbolic rather than personal?

68
00:04:38,614 --> 00:04:40,611
These are not radical questions.

69
00:04:40,611 --> 00:04:43,212
They are architectural ones.
