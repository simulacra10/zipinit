* Proposal (One Sentence)

*Legislative representation in Maryland should be apportioned by ZIP code rather than population, assigning one delegate per ZIP code, elected by voters residing within that ZIP.*

* 1. The Proposal

Maryland should adopt a geographic, lived-community standard for representation.

- *Unit:* U.S. Postal Service ZIP code
- *Rule:* *One Delegate per ZIP* (state House)
- *Selection:* Direct election by voters within each ZIP
- *Intent:* Restore proximity between representatives and the represented by shrinking constituency scale

This proposal treats population variance as a feature rather than a defect. In a republic, the purpose of representation is not mathematical equality in theory, but *real accountability in practice*.

* 2. The Problem with Population-Based Apportionment

Population-based apportionment predictably produces a scale mismatch. As populations concentrate and districts grow, proximity collapses. This is not a moral claim about any party; it is a structural claim about incentives.

** 2.1 Scale Mismatch

- As districts grow, representatives become less reachable and less personally accountable.
- Local problems are deprioritized as attention shifts to broad, media-driven issues.
- Representation becomes periodic mass voting rather than continuous civic contact.

** 2.2 Gerrymandering Becomes Rational

- When representation is tied to population totals, boundaries become the battlefield.
- Districting becomes a recurring contest for advantage, weakening legitimacy.
- Even “independent” maps cannot eliminate manipulation incentives; they only relocate who draws them.

** 2.3 Faction Consolidation

- Larger districts increase the value of money, endorsements, and institutional pipelines.
- Political outcomes concentrate around organized interests capable of operating at scale.
- Ordinary voters experience politics as distant, pre-decided, and unresponsive.

In short, population apportionment tends to produce representatives who are *formally legitimate* but *practically remote*.

* 3. Why ZIP Codes Work as a Representation Unit

ZIP codes are imperfect by design. Representation is a human system, not a geometry problem. ZIP codes are nevertheless effective because they are *real*, *lived*, and *difficult to game* for political advantage.

** 3.1 Lived Geography

- Most residents can identify their ZIP and recognize it as “their area.”
- ZIPs correlate with daily life: mail, schools, commuting, commerce, and shared services.

** 3.2 Cultural and Community Coherence

- ZIPs often align with towns, neighborhoods, or recognizable communities of interest.
- They preserve local distinctions that are lost in large, multi-community districts.

** 3.3 Resistance to Gerrymandering

- ZIP boundaries are not drawn by legislators for electoral advantage.
- Changes occur, but not primarily for partisan gain.

Design claim: A representation unit is effective if it reduces the ability of political actors to choose their voters and increases the ability of voters to know and pressure their representative.

* 4. Anticipated Objections and Direct Answers

** Objection A: ZIP codes were not designed for representation

Correct. They were designed for logistics. This is an advantage. It reduces partisan incentives to manipulate boundaries. Representation units do not need to be designed for politics; they need to be stable enough to use and real enough to live in.

** Objection B: Population equality is democratic

Population equality is one value among several. Extreme scale weakens accountability. This proposal prioritizes *proximity*, *diffusion of power*, and *resistance to capture* over abstract equality that cannot be operationalized into meaningful consent.

** Objection C: This will change the composition of the legislature

It will change incentives. That is the point. A system should not be judged by whether it produces a preferred outcome, but by whether it reliably produces *responsive representation*.

** Objection D: ZIP codes change over time

They do, gradually. Any workable implementation can adopt a fixed reference date per cycle. Change is manageable. The deeper problem is political boundary manipulation, which this proposal seeks to minimize.

* 5. Constitutional and Practical Plausibility

This brief does not offer legal advice. It makes an institutional claim: states possess broad authority to design their internal legislative structures, and historical practice shows wide variation in state representation models.

- Maryland may define representation units through constitutional or statutory design.
- ZIP boundaries are documented, public, and administratively usable.
- Election administration is straightforward: residence determines ZIP constituency.

* 6. What Success Looks Like

This initiative is outcome-bound. It does not exist to fundraise, brand, or persist.

Success is measured by institutional movement:

- Formal introduction of ZIP-apportionment legislation or amendment language
- Establishment of a legislative study commission or public hearing
- On-record engagement by Maryland officials addressing the proposal on the merits

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Closing claim: If representation exists to secure consent, proximity matters. Where proximity collapses, legitimacy becomes thin. ZIP-based apportionment offers a concrete way to restore human scale to self-government.
