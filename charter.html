<h1>Charter of the ZIP Apportionment Initiative</h1>

<h2>I. Purpose</h2>

<p>
The ZIP Apportionment Initiative exists for one purpose only:
</p>

<p>
<strong>
To articulate, defend, and advance the adoption of ZIP-code–based apportionment
for state legislative representation, beginning with Maryland.
</strong>
</p>

<p>
This Initiative is not a general advocacy organization, political party,
or permanent institution. It exists solely to pursue clearly defined
institutional outcomes related to this objective.
</p>

<h2>II. Scope of Work</h2>

<p>
The Initiative may engage only in activities directly related to its stated
purpose, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Research, writing, and publication of essays and briefs</li>
  <li>Public argument, debate, and critique</li>
  <li>Communication with legislators, officials, and the public</li>
  <li>Formal testimony or submissions when appropriate</li>
  <li>Open preservation of arguments and source materials</li>
</ul>

<p>
The Initiative shall not expand its mission beyond this scope.
</p>

<h2>III. Volunteer Structure</h2>

<p>
The Initiative is entirely volunteer-driven.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>No salaries, stipends, or compensation of any kind</li>
  <li>Participation is voluntary and non-exclusive</li>
  <li>Roles are functional, temporary, and task-specific</li>
  <li>No permanent titles or spokesperson positions</li>
</ul>

<p>
Reimbursement for direct, documented expenses may be permitted on a
pass-through basis only.
</p>

<h2>IV. Financial Constraints</h2>

<p>
The Initiative shall not exist to raise or manage funds as an end in itself.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>No paid staff</li>
  <li>No ongoing financial obligations</li>
  <li>Funds used only for direct, mission-specific expenses</li>
</ul>

<h2>V. Transparency and Open Publication</h2>

<p>
All substantive work produced by the Initiative shall be made publicly available.
</p>

<p>
The Initiative claims no ownership over the ideas it advances. Its goal is
dissemination, not control.
</p>

<h2>VI. Outcome-Based Termination</h2>

<p>
The Initiative has no fixed lifespan. It exists only until one of the following
conditions is met:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>ZIP-based apportionment is formally adopted</li>
  <li>A ZIP-based proposal is formally introduced into legislative proceedings</li>
  <li>A governmental body issues a definitive ruling on the proposal</li>
  <li>The originators publicly declare the effort concluded or abandoned</li>
</ul>

<p>
Upon the occurrence of any such condition, the Initiative shall dissolve
automatically.
</p>

<h2>VII. Non-Institutional Principle</h2>

<p>
The Initiative explicitly rejects institutional permanence.
</p>

<p>
It shall not seek to grow, brand itself, or persist beyond its stated purpose.
</p>

<h2>VIII. Amendment</h2>

<p>
This Charter may be amended only to clarify scope, tighten constraints,
or accelerate termination. No amendment may expand the mission or
permit compensation.
</p>

<h2>IX. Closing Statement</h2>

<p>
<em>
This Initiative exists to force a serious institutional question into public
consideration. It does not exist to survive. When its work is complete—or
rendered impossible—it will end.
</em>
